A Chance To Bloom is an immersive story experience based on the true story of an African migrantâ€™s journey to Europe from The Gambia. The experience will unfold as a interactive map narrative chronicling the journey of main character Mustapha. Viewers will be exposed to the process of migrating to Africa through virtual and audible encounters with poverty, violence, and modern day slavery. Using P5 Javascript Editor I was able to to have the users pressed on different locations of Mustapha had visited. Once pressed it would display messages from our main character at that point in his journey.
